"ML-MG: Multi-label Learning with Missing Labels Using a Mixed Graph", ICCV 2015


It includes:
1 -- A demo based on Corel5k dataset. 
2 -- matlab codes of our method, evaluation metrics and one toolbox
    2.1 -- 'vlfeat-0.9.19' is used to compute the example similarity based on kd-tree, and it is downloaded from 'http://www.vlfeat.org/'
